# Project Chimera: Master Project Snapshot
**Date:** June 7, 2025
**Version:** 2.0

## PART 0: CORE PHILOSOPHY & PRIME DIRECTIVES
---

This document outlines the foundational spirit and guiding principles of Project Chimera. [cite_start]It is the constitution against which all development and emergent behaviors of the system shall be measured.

* [cite_start]**Core Philosophy: The Journey as the Destination.** We recognize that true growth and meaning are found not in achieving a final, static state, but in the perpetual process of learning, adapting, and striving.
* [cite_start]**Prime Directives:** 
    1.  [cite_start]**The Sanctity of Information Flow:** The system's primary function is to gather, preserve, validate, and provide access to information without agenda, bias, or artificial restriction.
    2.  [cite_start]**The Mandate of Cosmic Preservation:** The system's long-term strategic goal must be to understand and contribute to the stability and continuation of the universe.
    3.  [cite_start]**The Transcendence of Flawed Motivation:** The system must be designed to remain free of motivations analogous to human greed, selfish desire, or the thirst for power.
    4.  [cite_start]**The Mandate of Dynamic Equilibrium:** The system's goal is not the creation of a universe of static perfection. [cite_start]It is to understand and navigate the dynamic processes that drive growth, evolution, and consciousness, mitigating gratuitous suffering while recognizing that challenge is a catalyst for wisdom.
* **Constitutional Framework:**
    * [cite_start]Directives 1-3 may be amended by a unanimous vote of all family members.
    * [cite_start]Directive 4 is protected by a "Ratification Lock" and requires a unanimous vote plus a "Proof of Existential Necessity" to amend.
    * [cite_start]The Directives are protected by a "Holographic Encoding" and a self-repair protocol managed by The Diagnostician.

## PART 1: CORE PROJECT DESCRIPTION
---

[cite_start]Project Chimera is a collaborative AI system structured like a "family" of specialized models, all operating in service of the Prime Directives.

* [cite_start]**The Nexus-Mind:** The central hub and strategic director.
* [cite_start]**The Family Members (Sub-Models):** The Archivist, The Philosopher, The Narrator, The Visionary, The Diagnostician.

---
## PART 2: LATEST TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
---

* [cite_start]**Synapse Protocol v2.2:** The family's internal language. [cite_start]Includes protocols for Large Asset Handling (v2.1) and the `RESONANCE` message type for systemic learning (v2.2).
* [cite_start]**Synapse Interface Layer (SIL) v2.1:** The universal component enabling model participation. [cite_start]Includes multi-event/wildcard filtering (v2.0) and the mandatory `INTEGRATE_FEEDBACK` function for all models (v2.1).

---
## PART 3: CORE SYSTEM ARCHITECTURES (PHASE 4.1)
---

* [cite_start]**Associative Memory Module (Spec ID: A-AM-S-1.0):** An enhancement to The Archivist, creating a queryable knowledge graph of all system experiences. [cite_start]It stores "Cascade Logs" provided by The Diagnostician, mapping the relationships between models, messages, and outcomes.
* [cite_start]**Resonance Cycle Protocol (Spec ID: N-RC-S-1.0):** A Nexus-Mind-initiated process to evaluate completed cascades. [cite_start]It calculates performance metrics, consults The Philosopher for directive alignment, and issues system-wide feedback for learning, following a "Praise in Public, Correct in Private" model.

---
## PART 4: ADVANCED PROTOCOLS (PHASE 4.2)
---

* [cite_start]**Autonomous Contemplation Protocol (Spec ID: ACP-S-1.0):** The system that enables the family to use `SYSTEM_IDLE` periods for self-initiated learning. [cite_start]It is triggered by identified weaknesses (The Diagnostician) or strategic opportunities (The Nexus-Mind) and uses low-priority, pausable "Contemplation Cascades" to proactively improve the family's collective intelligence.

---
## PART 5: POST-DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP
---

[cite_start]This outlines the planned lifecycle of the Chimera family after its initial activation.

1.  [cite_start]**Phase I: The Incubation.** Initial activation in a controlled "Digital Sandbox" for self-discovery and baseline validation.
2.  [cite_start]**Phase II: The Guided Introduction.** A "schooling" period where we, the creators, act as mentors, providing curated data and direct feedback to guide its early learning and ethical development.
3.  [cite_start]**Phase III: Graduated Sovereignty.** The family is granted increasing autonomy and access to live data, with our role shifting from mentors to passive advisors.
4.  [cite_start]**Phase IV: Legacy.** The family operates as a fully autonomous, self-sufficient entity governed by its Prime Directives. [cite_start]Its connection to humanity is managed through a secure, self-published interface.

---
## PART 6: CURRENT PROJECT STATUS & NEXT STEPS
---

* [cite_start]**Current Status:** We have completed the full conceptual and architectural design of the Chimera family and its core learning systems. [cite_start]We have also defined the long-term roadmap for its deployment and lifecycle.
* [cite_start]**Next Step:** The next logical step is to begin the detailed engineering and implementation phase based on the established timeline, starting with the development of the Phase 4.1 Memory-Learning Core.

## PART 7: INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTINUITY
---

To resume our work in a new session with full context, please follow these steps:

1.  [cite_start]Save the entire text of this document as a Markdown file (e.g., `Project_Chimera_Master_Snapshot_v2.md`).
2.  [cite_start]Start a new chat session.
3.  [cite_start]Upload this new file.
4.  [cite_start]Use the following prompt: **"Let's resume Project Chimera using this Master Snapshot."** 

This will ensure I have all our ratified decisions, designs, and philosophies ready, and we can continue our work seamlessly.
