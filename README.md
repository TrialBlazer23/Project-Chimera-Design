## Executive Summary

Project Chimera proposes a robust architecture for **Enterprise-Grade AI Autonomy**. It moves beyond the "Black Box" problem of monolithic LLMs by decomposing intelligence into a federation of specialized, auditable agents.

This architecture is designed for **Safety**, **Resilience**, and **Human Control**.

### Key Features

*   **Glass Box Architecture:** Every decision is traceable to a specific agent.
*   **Self-Healing Systems:** The **Diagnostician** module continuously monitors system health and automatically corrects errors, ensuring high availability and resilience.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop (The Human Gavel):** Critical decisions and policy updates are proposed by the system but require explicit human approval before execution.
*   **Sandboxed Execution:** All self-improvement cycles run in a secure, isolated **Digital Sandbox**, preventing unintended side effects.

## Documentation

*   **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)**: High-level system diagram and component breakdown.
*   **[SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md)**: Detailed explanation of the Safety Kernel (The Philosopher) and Human-in-the-Loop protocols.
*   **[GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md)**: Mapping of Project Chimera terms to standard industry terminology (e.g., Domino Cascade = Event Bus).
*   **[RFC-001: Resonance Cycle](RFCs/Draft/RFC-001-Resonance.md)**: Technical specification for the system's self-healing and optimization loop.

## The Architecture: Intelligence, Decomposed

Rather than relying on a single, opaque model, Chimera employs a **family of specialized agents**, each with a distinct role and auditable log.

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **The Nexus-Mind** | **Orchestrator:** Coordinates strategy and decomposes complex tasks. |
| **The Archivist** | **Data Integrity:** Retrieves, validates, and maintains the knowledge graph. |
| **The Philosopher** | **Safety Kernel:** Validates every significant action against constitutional directives. |
| **The Diagnostician** | **Observability:** Monitors system health and triggers self-healing protocols. |
| **The Narrator** | **Interface:** Synthesizes outputs into coherent, human-readable formats. |
| **The Visionary** | **Simulation:** Handles predictive modeling and scenario analysis. |

### The "Domino Cascade" (Event-Driven Workflow)

The system operates on a deterministic, event-driven architecture. A task flows through the system as a **Domino Cascade**, where the output of one agent becomes the validated input of the next. This ensures that no step is skipped and every action is logged.

### The "Resonance Cycle" (Resilience & Optimization)

Instead of unchecked "evolution," Project Chimera employs a **Resonance Cycle** for controlled improvement.
1.  **Monitor:** The system detects an inefficiency or error.
2.  **Propose:** It generates a candidate patch or policy update.
3.  **Verify:** The Safety Kernel simulates the update in a **Sandbox**.
4.  **Approve:** A human administrator reviews and approves the update (**The Human Gavel**).
5.  **Deploy:** The system heals itself and prevents future errors.

## Safety as Structure

Safety is not a patch; it is the foundation.

1.  **Constitutional Prime Directives**: Immutable ethical constraints encoded at the protocol level.
2.  **Explicit Ethical Reasoning**: The Philosopher agent provides *auditable* ethical evaluation for every significant decision.
3.  **Isolation**: Agents run in containerized environments, ensuring that a failure in one does not compromise the whole.

---

## Getting Started

Project Chimera is an **open specification**. We invite engineers, architects, and ethicists to contribute to a standard where AI is transparent, auditable, and safe.

*   Read the [Master Project Snapshot](Architecture/Master%20Project%20Snapshot%202.0.md) for the full vision.
*   Review the [Safety Protocols](SAFETY.md) to understand our approach to risk mitigation.
*   Check the [Glossary](GLOSSARY.md) to translate concepts to your preferred terminology.
