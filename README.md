See [QUICK_ASSESSMENT.md](QUICK_ASSESSMENT.md) for feasibility analysis and [IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) for development plans.

> **The Philosophy:** Current AI models are Black Boxes. Aletheia is a **Glass Box**. It separates *Generation* (The Narrator) from *Judgment* (The Philosopher) to create agents that are safe, auditable, and capable of recursive self-improvement.

## 🏗️ The Architecture

Aletheia is not a single model. It is a **Multi-Agent System (MAS)** composed of specialized "Organs" that communicate via the **Domino Cascade** (Event Bus).

### 1. The Family (Agent Roles)

| Agent | Role | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Nexus-Mind** | Orchestrator | Strategic planning, task decomposition, and resource allocation. The "System 2" thinker. |
| **Philosopher** | Ethical Kernel | A Neuro-Symbolic auditor that validates outputs against "Prime Directives" *before* execution. |
| **Archivist** | Memory Core | Manages the Knowledge Graph using deterministic dependency parsing (Spacy) to prevent hallucinations. |
| **Diagnostician** | Self-Healing | Monitors the event bus for infinite loops or failures. Triggers the **Resonance Cycle** to patch policy errors. |
| **Narrator** | Interface | Synthesizes complex data into human-readable narrative. |

### 2. Core Mechanics

#### The Domino Cascade (Event-Driven Flow)

Unlike linear chains, Aletheia agents operate asynchronously.

> *Example:* `USER_INPUT` -> **Archivist** (retrieves context) -> `CONTEXT_READY` -> **Narrator** (drafts response) -> `DRAFT_READY` -> **Philosopher** (audits draft) -> `APPROVED` -> **User**.

#### The Resonance Cycle (Recursive Improvement)

The system does not just log errors; it learns from them.

1. **Experience:** The system logs a failure (e.g., a loop or a rejected draft).
2. **Reflection:** The Nexus-Mind analyzes the *Cascade Log*.
3. **Mutation:** The system proposes an update to its `Operational_Policy.json`.
4. **Verification:** The Philosopher validates the new policy.
5. **Integration:** The agent's behavior is permanently updated.

## 📊 Project Analysis & Roadmap

**Status: Pre-Implementation Phase** - This repository contains comprehensive architectural documentation. Implementation has not yet begun.

### Available Documentation

* **[QUICK_ASSESSMENT.md](QUICK_ASSESSMENT.md)** - Executive summary and feasibility analysis (5 min read)
* **[ANALYSIS.md](ANALYSIS.md)** - Comprehensive technical review of the architecture, strengths, challenges, and recommendations (20 min read)
* **[IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)** - Phased implementation plan with timelines, resource requirements, and code examples (30 min read)

### Key Findings

✅ **Core architecture is viable** - Multi-agent orchestration and event-driven workflows are proven patterns  
✅ **Safety-first design is innovative** - Dedicated validation agent (The Philosopher) is architecturally sound  
⚠️ **Requires staged implementation** - Build MVP (3-agent system) before attempting full Resonance Cycle  
⚠️ **Research components need caution** - Self-modifying AI should start with human-supervised parameter tuning  

**Recommendation:** Proceed with phased implementation starting with a 3-agent prototype (Nexus-Mind, Archivist, Narrator). Estimated timeline to production-ready system: 18-24 months.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Future Implementation)

**Note:** The implementation described below does not yet exist. See [IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md) for development plans.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Spacy (`en_core_web_sm`)
* Message Bus (RabbitMQ or Redis)
* Vector Database (Pinecone, Weaviate, or similar)
* LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local via Ollama)

### Installation (Planned)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TrialBlazer23/Aletheia-Framework.git
cd Aletheia-Framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
```

### Running the Prototype (Planned)

To launch the `Nexus-Mind` console:
```bash
python main.py
```
